The only thing wrong with the animation, is the way the players are always tripping on each other.<br /><br />The gameplay is still slowed down by the bloated pre-play controls. What used to take two buttons is now a giant PITA to get done before an opponent snaps the ball or the play clock runs out.<br /><br />The turbo button is back, but the player movement is still slow and awkward. If you liked last years version, I'm guessing you'll like this too. I haven't had a chance to play anything other than training and a few online games, so I'm crossing my fingers and hoping the rest is better.<br /><br />The one thing I can recommend is NOT TO BUY THE MADDEN BUNDLE. The game comes as a download. So if you hate it, there's no trading it in at Gamestop.\",\n",
